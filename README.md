The final project done from the mockup encountered here: https://marvelapp.com/ei1je2#

------------- INSTRUCTIONS -----------------
1. Please, run npm install for some package.json depencies
2. After that, run gulp normally.
3. I used a Google Chrome Browser (50.0.2661.102 (64-bit)) on a Mac computer and the resposive version on a Chrome Browser on an Android phone.

------------- OBSERVATIONS -----------------
As I was coding this form, I noticed that some of the input could be simplified for the final users.
For example, instead of asking the user to type favorite Star Wars movie, why won't we show the options since it's a limit source.
The same is applied to the "Bolacha"/"Biscoito" input.

In the TV Shows input, I pre loaded a bunch of names to make it easier, again, to the user to select it. If he/she didn't find one, it's 
possible to add a new one.

while choosing his/her favorite food, I used a checkbox instead of a radio-button, because a user could have more than one favorite foods.

There are some aesthetical adjustments, like some movie posters and food icons to generate a better experience.
